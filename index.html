          Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey!
          If you're looking for environment setup instructions,
          they've moved to <span class="under">their own section</span>. Continue reading for
          an introduction to the documentation, Native
          Components, React, and more!

          React Native is an open source framework for building Android
          and iOS applications using <span class="under">React</span> and the app
          platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript
          to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to
          describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components:
          <span class="ital">bundles of reusable, nestable code</span>. You
          can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs
          cover how components work in React Native.

          React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for
          building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make
          the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself.
          This section can get you started or can serve as
          a refresher course.
        </p>
        <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
        <p>
          <span class="bold">&#43 components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses
          cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures
          that need names and a cafe to work in.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="bold">&#43 JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets
          you write elements inside JavaScript like so:
          <span class="bc">&ltText&gtHello, I am your cat!&lt&#47Text&gt</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The React docs have <span class="under">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can
          refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript,
          you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring
          a <span class="bc">name</span> for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces
          inside <span class="bc">&ltText&gt</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="bold">&#43 props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</p>
        <p>
          <span class="bold">&#43 state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments you use
          to configure how components render, state is like a
          component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling
          data that changes over time or that comes from
          user interaction. State gives your components memory!
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <hr class="section-hr">
        <div class="headers">
          <h2 id="handling">handling text input</h2>
          <span>Chapter 4</span>
        </div>
        <p>
          TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter
          text. It has an <span class="ital">onChangeText</span> prop that takes a
          function to be called every time the text changed, and an
          onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called
          when the text is submitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
          their words into a different language. In this
          new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï.
          So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated
          as "üçï üçï".
