        Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey!
        If you're looking for environment setup instructions,
        they've moved to their own section. Continue reading for
        an introduction to the documentation, Native
        Components, React, and more!

        React Native is an open source framework for building Android
        and iOS applications using React and the app
        platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript
        to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to
        describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components:
        bundles of reusable, nestable code. You
        can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs
        cover how components work in React Native.

      <p>
        React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for
        building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make
        the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself.
        This section can get you started or can serve as
        a refresher course.
      </p>

      <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
      <p>
        &#43 components. The rest of this introduction to React uses
        cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures
        that need names and a cafe to work in.
      </p>
      <p>
        &#43 JSX. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets
        you write elements inside JavaScript like so:
        &ltText&gtHello, I am your cat!&lt&#47Text&gt.
      </p>
      <p>
        The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can
        refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript,
        you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring
        a name for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces
        inside &ltText&gt
      </p>
      <p>&#43 props. Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</p>
      <p>
        &#43 state. While you can think of props as arguments you use
        to configure how components render, state is like a
        component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling
        data that changes over time or that comes from
        user interaction. State gives your components memory!
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <div class="headers">
        <h2>handling text input</h2>
        <span>Chapter 4</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter
        text. It has an onChangeText prop that takes a
        function to be called every time the text changed, and an
        onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called
        when the text is submitted.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
        their words into a different language. In this
        new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï.
        So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated
        as "üçï üçï".
